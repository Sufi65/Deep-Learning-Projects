# Deep-Learning-Projects
“Deep learning projects showcasing real-world AI applications: image classification, face mask detection, handwritten digit recognition, and tweet sentiment analysis.”
This repository contains hands-on deep learning projects showcasing practical applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and natural language processing techniques. Each project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation to solve real-world problems.

Projects Included

Face Mask Detector
A real-time mask detection system using CNNs and OpenCV. The model identifies whether a person is wearing a mask or not, useful for public safety compliance.

Handwritten Digit Classification
Recognizes handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset using CNNs. Demonstrates image classification with high accuracy through deep learning.

Sentiment Analysis on Tweets
Performs sentiment classification of tweets into positive, negative, or neutral using LSTM/GRU networks. Includes text preprocessing, tokenization, and handling noisy social media data.

Image Classifier using CNN
A general-purpose multi-class image classifier trained on datasets like CIFAR-10. Demonstrates CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers for image recognition tasks.
